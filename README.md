# gender conscious routing

Routing along streets named after women rather than men.

*Disclaimer*: This package presumes that gender is binary. Which it is
not. The package and its developers neither endorse nor encourage
viewing gender in binary terms. This binary distinction is nevertheless
hard-coded here because the package relies on a library coded elsewhere
to associate names with genders, and which provides only binary
definitions of gender. The library nevertheless allows gender
associations in a very wide variety of languages, far more than any
other equivalent library, and so allows the functionality of this
package to be applied to far greater regions of the world that would
other, non-binary alternatives. See the vignette for further detail on
the gender encoding system used here.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Generating gender-conscious routes

The function `conscious_route()` calculates routes which preferentially
traverse streets named after women. Usage requires downloading a street
network, the simplest way of which is to use [the `dodgr`
package](https://github.com/atfutures/dodgr). It is good practice to
save networks locally, to avoid having to repeat calls to the Open
Street Map servers which deliver the data.

``` r
city <- "Aachen Germany"
net <- dodgr::dodgr_streetnet_sc (city)
saveRDS (net, "mynetwork.Rds")
```

The gender of all streets can then be appended to the network data with
the `gender_streetnet()` function, which also accepts an additional
parameter, `wt_profile`, used to specify the weighting profile from [the
profiles of the `dodgr`
package](https://atfutures.github.io/dodgr/reference/weighting_profiles.html).

``` r
library (genderconsciousrouting)
net <- gender_streetnet (dat, wt_profile = "foot")
```

Gender-conscious routes can then be generated by specifying start and
end points. The following example selects random points from the network
vertices.

``` r
v <- dodgr::dodgr_vertices (net)
set.seed (1)
start <- sample (v$id, size = 1L)
stop <- sample (v$id, size = 1L)
```

Those `id` values are the Open Street Map identifiers of two random
vertices (or “nodes” in Open Street Map terms) of the network. Finally,
the following code calculates the path between them which traverses the
greatest proportional length along streets named after women:

``` r
conscious_route (net, start = start, stop = stop)
#> $p_stats
#>         d_female  d_male    d_non  p_female     p_male     p_non path_length path_length_rel
#> default    0.000 190.454 8277.046 0.0000000 0.02249235 0.9775076     8467.50        1.000000
#> female  1826.583 335.371 8083.941 0.1782746 0.03273223 0.7889932    10245.89        1.210026
#> 
#> $paths
#>      type                       geometry
#> 1 default LINESTRING (6.166698 50.812...
#> 2  female LINESTRING (6.166698 50.812...
#>
#> $points
#>               x        y    colour
#> 25722  6.166698 50.81288 #44FF22FF
#> 137140 6.020574 50.75566 #FF4422FF
```

The function returns a list of the following three items:

1.  `p_stats` providing statistics on absolute and relative distances
    along the types of ways (where “non” suffixes denote ways not named
    after people).
2.  `paths` providing the path geometries, both of the gender-conscious
    route, and the “default” route which does not follow gender
    conscious paths; and
3.  `points` with locations of the specified start and end points, along
    with colour codes which can be used to clearly indicate those points
    on interactive maps.
