# gender conscious routing

Routing along streets named after women rather than men.

*Disclaimer*: This package presumes that gender is binary. Which it is not. The
package and its developers neither endorse nor encourage viewing gender in
binary terms. This binary distinction is nevertheless hard-coded here because
the package relies on a library coded elsewhere to associate names with
genders, and which provides only binary definitions of gender. The library
nevertheless allows gender associations in a very wide variety of languages,
far more than any other equivalent library, and so allows the functionality of
this package to be applied to far greater regions of the world that would
other, non-binary alternatives. See the vignette for further detail on the
gender encoding system used here.
